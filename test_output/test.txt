Albuquerque, New Mexico505 –730 –5765 : Stimm48@unm.eduEducation:-Senior at the University of New Mexico: 4.15GPA.-Majoring in computer science, with a focus on algorithms.-GED recipient. -Relevant coursework:design of large programs, declarative programming, discrete mathematics, calculus, linear algebra, probabilistic inference, online algorithms.Skills:-Communication,teamwork, and leadership. I am the captain of theMen’s Ultimate Frisbee Team, which has meant leading the team on and off the field. I have managed our budget,paperwork,directed events, and lead our team on the field. -I have experience in a variety of programming languages, including:Java, C, SQL, Haskell, Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, Scheme, Rust, and Golang.-I have experience with creating machine learning and deep learning algorithms with TensorFlowand Torch. Transformer architectures and object detection are my specialties.-Whilecreating an AI to play 10 vs. 10 Tronfor an academic tournament, I also created a running program that would run two AI’s against each other (through calling the other program through the terminal), and collect stats about their matches. It really enhanced the viewing experience of the tournament and was used to set odds for matches.Experience:Employed as anR&Dintern at Sandia National Laboratories(2019 -Present).-I have managed the deployment andmanagementof multiple production web applications during my time at Sandia National Labs. These projects have incorporated a wide variety of languages (including SQL, JavaScript, PHP, and HTML) and libraries, such as Angular, React, and Angularjs.-I was a coauthor on a mathematics course at Sandia National Laboratories. The course, “Mathematics of Machine Learning”, included topics such as multivariate calculus, linear algebra, game theory, information theory, and mathematic structures.-I have developed and maintained a library dedicated to machine learning at Sandia National Laboratories, which allows for quicker writing of machine learning applications for the labs.Other Work Experience-Worked as a teacher’s assistant at Sandia Preparatory School’s Summer Prepprogram.-Engineering ambassador for the University of New Mexico School of Engineering.
